    money, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, tiles
  }
  upgrades: {                       // All upgrade trees
    mainShop, diamondShop, snakeShop, tetrisShop, tileShop
  }
  gameState: {                      // Game settings and unlocks
    health, maxHealth, clickValue, unlocks...
  }
  statistics: {                     // Player progress tracking
    totalClicks, gamesPlayed, playTime...
  }
}
```
